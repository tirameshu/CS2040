Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy Whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is a friend And remember also that in fighting against man we must not come to resemble him Even when you have conquered him do not adopt his vices No animal must ever live in a house or sleep in a bed or wear clothes or drink alcohol or smoke tobacco or touch money or engage in trade All the habits of man are evil And above all no animal must ever tyrannize over his own kind Weak or strong clever or simple we are all brothers No animal must ever kill any other animal All animals are equal
